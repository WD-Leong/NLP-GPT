# NLP Language Model using 1D Dilated Causal Convolutional Networks 
This repository includes the codes that I explored for language modelling using a 1D Dilated Causal Convolutional Networks. It is inspired from the [WaveNet Model](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio), which I modified and applied to the Language Modelling task. 

This repository includes a code to train the data on the [Reddit Jokes](https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset) dataset.
